      "lore_text": "In the realm of Snowcaller, a land carved by ice and fire, the echoes of ancient wars still whisper through the winds. Once, mighty empires clashed, their ruins now buried beneath frost and ash. The Guild rose from the chaos, a beacon for lost souls seeking purpose. You stand at its threshold, a wanderer in a world teetering on the edge of shadow. What tale will you weave in this frozen saga?"

      "quest_name": "Goblin Cleanup",
      "lore_text": "Long ago, the village of Eldwood thrived in peace, its fields golden with harvest. But then the goblins came—small, vicious creatures led by a cunning chieftain. They raided homes, stole livestock, and drove the villagers to despair. The elder, a weary man named Thane, once fought them off with a band of brave souls, but now he’s too old to wield a blade. He’s called upon the Guild, hoping a new hero will rise to cleanse the forest of this scourge."

      "quest_name": "Kobold Trouble",
      "lore_text": "The kobolds of Blackrock Caves were once mere nuisances, skittering in the shadows. But recently, they’ve grown bold, snatching supplies from merchant caravans under the cover of night. Some whisper they’re driven by a mysterious figure—a hooded stranger seen near the caves. The Guild’s contract is clear: stop the thefts, but the truth behind their sudden courage remains buried in the dark."

      "quest_name": "Dragon Slayer",
      "lore_text": "Legends speak of the Dragon of Stormpeak, a beast born from the fury of a shattered sky. Centuries ago, it razed kingdoms, its scales gleaming like molten gold under a storm of fire. Heroes fell, their names lost to ash, until it vanished into the mountains. Now, its roar echoes again, a challenge to the bold. The Guild offers a fortune, but whispers warn: this is no mere beast—it’s a force of ancient wrath."
