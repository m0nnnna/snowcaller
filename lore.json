      "lore_text": "In the realm of Snowcaller, a land ravaged by ice, echoes of ancient wars whisper through the winds. Once, mighty empires clashed; their ruins now lie buried beneath frost and ash. Since the world froze over, monsters and other creatures have spread across the frozen wastes. You have journeyed far to reach Brighthaven, one of the last bastions where fame can be forged. What adventures await you? What secrets of the old world will you unearth?"

      "quest_name": "Goblin Cleanup",
      "lore_text": "Long ago, the village of Eldwood thrived in peace, its fields among the last to bear a harvest. Then the goblins came—small, vicious creatures led by a cunning chieftain. They raided homes, stole livestock, and plunged the villagers into despair. The elder, a weary man named Thane, once repelled them with a band of brave souls, but age has robbed him of his sword arm. Now, he’s called upon the Guild, seeking a new hero to rid the land of this blight."

      "quest_name": "Kobold Trouble",
      "lore_text": "The kobolds of Blackrock Caves were once mere nuisances, skittering in the shadows. But recently, they’ve grown bold, snatching supplies from merchant caravans under the cover of night. Some whisper they’re driven by a mysterious figure—a hooded stranger seen near the caves. The Guild’s contract is clear: stop the thefts, but the truth behind their sudden courage remains buried in the dark."

      "quest_name": "Dragon Slayer",
      "lore_text": "Legends speak of the Dragon of Stormpeak, a beast born from the fury of a shattered sky. Centuries ago, it razed kingdoms, its scales gleaming like molten gold under a storm of fire. Heroes fell, their names lost to ash, until it vanished into the mountains. Now, its roar echoes again, a challenge to the bold. The Guild offers a fortune, but whispers warn: this is no mere beast—it’s a force of ancient wrath."
