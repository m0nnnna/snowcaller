Open event.json.

Create events by defining a name, spawn_chance, cooldown, optional level_range, one_time/triggered, description, optional choice_prompt, and outcomes

Outcome Types
item: Drops 1+ items from a JSON file (e.g., "treasures.json").

gold: Gives a random gold amount (e.g., 10-20).

heal: Restores % of max HP (e.g., 10-20%).

damage: Deals % of max HP damage (e.g., 5-15%).

lore: Displays a text message (e.g., "The wind howls...").

combat: Starts a fight with monsters (e.g., 2 Bandits).

```json
    {
        "name": "bandit_ambush",
        "spawn_chance": 15,
        "cooldown": 3,

            }
        ]
    },
```

2. Adding a New Quest

File: quest.json
Steps:
Open quest.json.

Add a new quest with required fields: quest_name, quest_level, quest_description, target_monster, kill_count_required, quest_reward.

Link it to a monster in monster.json.

Example: "Slay the Shadow Beast" quest:
```json
{
    "quest_name": "Slay the Shadow Beast",
    "quest_level": 10,
    "quest_description": "A dark creature terrorizes the woods. End its reign.",
    "target_monster": "Shadow Beast",
    "kill_count_required": 1,
    "quest_reward": "50 gold, Shadow Cloak"
}
```
Notes:
"target_monster": Must match a "name" in monster.json.

"quest_reward": Format as "X gold, Item Name".

Trigger via an event (e.g., "quest_giver") or guild menu.

3. Adding a New Monster

File: monster.json
Steps:
Open monster.json.

Add a new monster with fields: name, stats, level_range, damage_range, spawn_chance, gold_chance, armor_value, hp_range, rare.

Set spawn_chance to 0 for quest bosses.

Example: "Shadow Beast" (quest boss):
```json
{
    "name": "Shadow Beast",
    "stats": {"S": 6, "A": 4, "I": 3, "W": 4, "L": 2},
    "level_range": {"min": 12, "max": 15},
    "damage_range": {"min": 7, "max": 13},

    "armor_value": 30,
    "hp_range": {"min": 35, "max": 50},
    "rare": true,
    "notes": "Quest boss for Slay the Shadow Beast."
}
```

Example: "Goblin Scout" (regular monster):
```json
{
    "name": "Goblin Scout",
    "stats": {"S": 2, "A": 3, "I": 1, "W": 1, "L": 2},
    "level_range": {"min": 1, "max": 5},
    "damage_range": {"min": 2, "max": 4},
    "spawn_chance": 20,

    "armor_value": 10,
    "hp_range": {"min": 10, "max": 15},
    "rare": false
}
```

Notes:
"spawn_chance": 0 = quest boss, full level_range.

"rare": true = boss (random if spawn_chance > 0).

Stats (S, A, I, W, L) affect combat behavior.

4. Adding New Gear, Treasures, or Consumables

Gear (gear.json):
```json
{
    "name": "Shadow Cloak",
    "slot": "chest",
    "stats": {"A": 2, "L": 1},
    "modifier": "A",
    "armor_value": 15,
    "damage": null,
    "level_range": {"min": 10, "max": 15},
    "drop_rate": 5,
    "boss_only": true
}
```

Treasures (treasures.json):
```json
  {
    "name": "Gold Coin",
    "drop_rate": 0.1,
    "gold": 5,
    "boss_only": false
  },
```

Consumables (consumables.json):

    "value": 20,
    "stat": null,
    "duration": 0,
    "drop_rate": 0.05,
    "gold": 10,
    "boss_only": false
  },
```
Notes:
Use in events (e.g., "source": "gear.json") or quest rewards.

"drop_rate": Chance of dropping (used as weight in events).

5. Skills

Skills are of a given type and have many options.

Here are the type of effects you can use:
damage_bonus, direct_damage, heal, damage_over_time,

Here is how a skill looks 
```json
    {
      "class_type": "2",
      "level_req": 1,
      "name": "Fireball",
      "base_dmg": 5,
      "effect": "direct_damage",
      "mp_cost": 5,
      "duration": 0,
      "stat": "I"
    },
```
Class type 1 is warrior, 2 mage, 3 rogue.

**XP Give**

Inside of combat.py there is a line
```python
xp = level * 1 * (1.5 if monster_stats["rare"] or boss_fight else 1)
```
This will control the base XP and rate per level.

A value of 10 is 10 base and increased by 10 per level a level 3 will be 30 XP.

## Expanded Lore for Snowcaller

**The Shattering Frost**

In the annals of the old world, before the ice claimed all, the realm of Snowcaller was a tapestry of vibrant kingdoms, rolling fields, and towering forests. Magic pulsed through the land, wielded by sorcerers and guarded by hero's in the large empires. Goblins skulked in the shadows, a petty nuisance to the might of human empires. It was a world of balanceâ€”until the Shattering Frost descended.
No one knows its true origin. Some whisper of a betrayed god unleashing vengeance; others claim a cabal of reckless mages tore the veil between worlds, letting winterâ€™s heart bleed through. Whatever the cause, the skies darkened, the sun grew pale, and a relentless blizzard swept across the land. Rivers froze solid, crops withered beneath snowdrifts, and entire cities vanished under glacial tombs. The never-ending winter gripped Snowcaller, transforming it into an icy hell where survival became a daily defiance of natureâ€™s wrath.

**The Rise of the Beasts**

As humanity faltered, the creatures of the wild adapted and thrived. The Shattering Frost birthed a new breed of monstersâ€”ice-wrought horrors that revel in the cold. Goblins, once mere scavengers, grew bolder and more numerous, their tribes uniting under cunning warlords who saw opportunity in mankindâ€™s ruin. Dragons, long dormant, awoke from their mountain lairs, their scales gleaming with frost as they soared through blizzards, hunting weakened settlements. New abominations emerged from the ice: wraiths of frozen mist, hulking frost-trolls with hides like glaciers, and spectral wolves whose howls chill the soul itself.
Magic, too, twisted under the winterâ€™s influence. Once a tool of creation, it now often manifests as jagged, uncontrollable powerâ€”spells that freeze blood in veins or summon shards of ice from thin air. Those who wield it risk madness or worse, their bodies slowly crystallizing as the cold claims them from within.

**Humanity on the Brink**

The survivors of Snowcaller cling to life in scattered enclaves, their once-proud civilizations reduced to crumbling ruins or buried relics. Towns like Brighthaven stand as rare beacons, fortified against the ice and the monsters that roam beyond their walls. Built atop geothermal springs or ancient magical wards, these settlements offer fleeting warmth in a frozen wasteland, drawing adventurers, outcasts, and desperate souls seeking to carve out a nameâ€”or merely to live another day.
Farther afield, villages like Eldwood teeter on the edge of extinction. Once prosperous, they now huddle around dying hearths, their fields barren beneath the frost. Raids by goblin warbands or the sudden wrath of a dragon can snuff out such places in a night, leaving only whispers carried on the wind.
Humanityâ€™s numbers dwindle, pushed to the brink by starvation, cold, and ceaseless attacks. The old ordersâ€”knights, kings, and guildsâ€”have fractured, replaced by ragtag bands of warriors, opportunistic warlords, and the enigmatic Guild, a loose alliance of heroes and mercenaries who answer calls for aid in exchange for coin, shelter, or secrets of the lost world.

**The Echoes of the Past**

Beneath the ice lie the bones of a grander age. Ruined citadels, frozen battlefields, and forgotten temples hold relics of power: enchanted blades, dragon-hoarded gold, and tomes of magic that might yet turn back the frostâ€”or doom the world further. Legends speak of the Snowcaller, a mythic figure or force tied to the winterâ€™s origin. Some say itâ€™s a slumbering titan beneath the glaciers, others a cursed artifact buried in the deepest ice. Whatever it is, its name has become a rallying cry for those who dream of ending the eternal coldâ€”and a curse for those who fear its awakening.

**The Struggle**
In Snowcaller, hope is a fragile thing, snuffed out as easily as a candle in a storm. The land is a merciless crucible where survival demands sacrifice, and heroism often ends in unmarked graves. Goblins gnaw at the edges of civilization, dragons rule the skies with indifferent cruelty, and the ice itself seems alive, creeping ever closer to swallow what remains. Yet amid the despair, sparks of defiance flickerâ€”whether in the blade of a lone warrior facing a frost-troll or the muttered prayers of a village elder like Thane, clinging to the past.
What will you become in this frozen hell? A savior seeking to unravel the Shattering Frostâ€™s mystery? A scavenger profiting from the chaos? Or just another corpse lost to the snow?
