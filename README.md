## Expanded Lore for Snowcaller

**The Shattering Frost**

In the annals of the old world, before the ice claimed all, the realm of Snowcaller was a tapestry of vibrant kingdoms, rolling fields, and towering forests. Magic pulsed through the land, wielded by sorcerers and guarded by hero's in the large empires. Goblins skulked in the shadows, a petty nuisance to the might of human empires. It was a world of balance—until the Shattering Frost descended.
No one knows its true origin. Some whisper of a betrayed god unleashing vengeance; others claim a cabal of reckless mages tore the veil between worlds, letting winter's heart bleed through. Whatever the cause, the skies darkened, the sun grew pale, and a relentless blizzard swept across the land. Rivers froze solid, crops withered beneath snowdrifts, and entire cities vanished under glacial tombs. The never-ending winter gripped Snowcaller, transforming it into an icy hell where survival became a daily defiance of nature's wrath.

**The Rise of the Beasts**

As humanity faltered, the creatures of the wild adapted and thrived. The Shattering Frost birthed a new breed of monsters—ice-wrought horrors that revel in the cold. Goblins, once mere scavengers, grew bolder and more numerous, their tribes uniting under cunning warlords who saw opportunity in mankind's ruin. Dragons, long dormant, awoke from their mountain lairs, their scales gleaming with frost as they soared through blizzards, hunting weakened settlements. New abominations emerged from the ice: wraiths of frozen mist, hulking frost-trolls with hides like glaciers, and spectral wolves whose howls chill the soul itself.
Magic, too, twisted under the winter's influence. Once a tool of creation, it now often manifests as jagged, uncontrollable power—spells that freeze blood in veins or summon shards of ice from thin air. Those who wield it risk madness or worse, their bodies slowly crystallizing as the cold claims them from within.

**Humanity on the Brink**

The survivors of Snowcaller cling to life in scattered enclaves, their once-proud civilizations reduced to crumbling ruins or buried relics. Towns like Brighthaven stand as rare beacons, fortified against the ice and the monsters that roam beyond their walls. Built atop geothermal springs or ancient magical wards, these settlements offer fleeting warmth in a frozen wasteland, drawing adventurers, outcasts, and desperate souls seeking to carve out a name—or merely to live another day.
Farther afield, villages like Eldwood teeter on the edge of extinction. Once prosperous, they now huddle around dying hearths, their fields barren beneath the frost. Raids by goblin warbands or the sudden wrath of a dragon can snuff out such places in a night, leaving only whispers carried on the wind.
Humanity's numbers dwindle, pushed to the brink by starvation, cold, and ceaseless attacks. The old orders—knights, kings, and guilds—have fractured, replaced by ragtag bands of warriors, opportunistic warlords, and the enigmatic Guild, a loose alliance of heroes and mercenaries who answer calls for aid in exchange for coin, shelter, or secrets of the lost world.

**The Echoes of the Past**

Beneath the ice lie the bones of a grander age. Ruined citadels, frozen battlefields, and forgotten temples hold relics of power: enchanted blades, dragon-hoarded gold, and tomes of magic that might yet turn back the frost—or doom the world further. Legends speak of the Snowcaller, a mythic figure or force tied to the winter's origin. Some say it's a slumbering titan beneath the glaciers, others a cursed artifact buried in the deepest ice. Whatever it is, its name has become a rallying cry for those who dream of ending the eternal cold—and a curse for those who fear its awakening.

**The Struggle**
In Snowcaller, hope is a fragile thing, snuffed out as easily as a candle in a storm. The land is a merciless crucible where survival demands sacrifice, and heroism often ends in unmarked graves. Goblins gnaw at the edges of civilization, dragons rule the skies with indifferent cruelty, and the ice itself seems alive, creeping ever closer to swallow what remains. Yet amid the despair, sparks of defiance flicker—whether in the blade of a lone warrior facing a frost-troll or the muttered prayers of a village elder like Thane, clinging to the past.
What will you become in this frozen hell? A savior seeking to unravel the Shattering Frost's mystery? A scavenger profiting from the chaos? Or just another corpse lost to the snow?
