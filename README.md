**Creating Things**

1. Adding a New Event
File: event.json
Steps:
Open event.json.

Add a new entry with name, spawn_chance, description, and outcomes.

Define outcomes (e.g., "item", "quest", "heal") with appropriate fields.

Example: "Hidden Cache" event giving gear or gold:
```json
{
    "name": "hidden_cache",
    "spawn_chance": 15,
    "description": "You stumble upon a concealed cache in the underbrush.",
    "outcomes": [
        {
            "type": "item",
            "source": "gear.json",
            "count": {"min": 1, "max": 1},
            "weight": 70
        },
        {
            "type": "gold",
            "amount": {"min": 15, "max": 25},
            "weight": 30
        }
    ]
}
```

Notes:
"spawn_chance": Adjusts likelihood (total weights donâ€™t need to sum to 100).

"weight": Relative chance among outcomes if multiple are listed.

Add "choice_prompt" and "requires_choice": true for player decisions (e.g., "1. Open | 2. Leave").

2. Adding a New Quest

File: quest.json
Steps:
Open quest.json.

Add a new quest with required fields: quest_name, quest_level, quest_description, target_monster, kill_count_required, quest_reward.

Link it to a monster in monster.json.

Example: "Slay the Shadow Beast" quest:
```json
{
    "quest_name": "Slay the Shadow Beast",
    "quest_level": 10,
    "quest_description": "A dark creature terrorizes the woods. End its reign.",
    "target_monster": "Shadow Beast",
    "kill_count_required": 1,
    "quest_reward": "50 gold, Shadow Cloak"
}
```
Notes:
"target_monster": Must match a "name" in monster.json.

"quest_reward": Format as "X gold, Item Name".

Trigger via an event (e.g., "quest_giver") or guild menu.

3. Adding a New Monster

File: monster.json
Steps:
Open monster.json.

Add a new monster with fields: name, stats, level_range, damage_range, spawn_chance, gold_chance, armor_value, hp_range, rare.

Set spawn_chance to 0 for quest bosses.

Example: "Shadow Beast" (quest boss):
```json
{
    "name": "Shadow Beast",
    "stats": {"S": 6, "A": 4, "I": 3, "W": 4, "L": 2},
    "level_range": {"min": 12, "max": 15},
    "damage_range": {"min": 7, "max": 13},
    "spawn_chance": 0,
    "gold_chance": 80,
    "armor_value": 30,
    "hp_range": {"min": 35, "max": 50},
    "rare": true,
    "notes": "Quest boss for Slay the Shadow Beast."
}
```

Example: "Goblin Scout" (regular monster):
```json
{
    "name": "Goblin Scout",
    "stats": {"S": 2, "A": 3, "I": 1, "W": 1, "L": 2},
    "level_range": {"min": 1, "max": 5},
    "damage_range": {"min": 2, "max": 4},
    "spawn_chance": 20,
    "gold_chance": 50,
    "armor_value": 10,
    "hp_range": {"min": 10, "max": 15},
    "rare": false
}
```

Notes:
"spawn_chance": 0 = quest boss, full level_range.

"rare": true = boss (random if spawn_chance > 0).

Stats (S, A, I, W, L) affect combat behavior.

4. Adding New Gear, Treasures, or Consumables

Gear (gear.json):
```json
{
    "name": "Shadow Cloak",
    "slot": "chest",
    "stats": {"A": 2, "L": 1},
    "modifier": "A",
    "armor_value": 15,
    "damage": null,
    "level_range": {"min": 10, "max": 15},
    "drop_rate": 5,
    "boss_only": true
}
```

Treasures (treasures.json):
```json
{"name": "Silver Ring", "drop_rate": 40}
```

Consumables (consumables.json):
```json
{"name": "Mana Elixir", "level_range": {"min": 5, "max": 15}, "drop_rate": 15, "boss_only": false}
```
Notes:
Use in events (e.g., "source": "gear.json") or quest rewards.

"drop_rate": Chance of dropping (used as weight in events).
